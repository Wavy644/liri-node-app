# liri-node-app

Liri is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a "Language" Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

This app is run via CLI

Tech involved:

Visual-Studio-Code
NodeJS
Node-Spotify-API
Axios
OMDB API
Bands In Town API
Moment
DotEnv

I am the primary developer for this app.
